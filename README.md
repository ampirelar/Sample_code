# Sample code repository
Author: Ana Pirela-Rios

This repository has some sample codes on the processing and cleaning of microdata and satellite images, as well as the creation of descriptive statistics and econometric analyses in R and Stata.

## The R sample code contains the processing of Global Forest Change (Hansen et al., 2013) tree cover satellite data, the creation of a municipality-year level panel, and descriptive statistics (maps and bar charts). 
## The STATA sample code contains the processing of individual-level data related to the technical assistance visits received by coffee growers in Colombia between 2007 and 2013. This code cleans the raw data and matches the coffee grower information with its farm ID to create a farm-level panel of coffee farms productive characteristics.
